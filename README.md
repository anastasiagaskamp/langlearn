# langlearn
A site that talks about programming languages and the like.  

## help out
This is meant to contain information on most languages, including the esoteric ones. If you know about a language and want to add it onto the project, use the template section at the bottom of the page to figure out how to add a new section. It's not rocket science.  
For adding a language, you need this information:
* The language 
* What it is used for
* An image of some code made in it
* A link to external resources, such as where to learn it, what books are useful, a wikipedia page on it, etc.
* General information on the language
